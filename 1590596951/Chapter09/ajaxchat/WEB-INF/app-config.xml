  <!-- maxMessages is the maximum number of messages that will be stored in -->
  <!-- the messages collection of each room.  Any time a message is posted -->
  <!-- to a room, the number of messages in the collection is checked -->
  <!-- against this value.  If the count exceeds this value, the collection -->
  <!-- is cleared before the new messages is stored.  This is just a -->
  <!-- memory-saving measure, and probably makes things a bit more -->
  <!-- efficient too. -->

  <!-- userInactivitySeconds is the maximum number of seconds that can -->
  <!-- elapse between Ajax requests before a user is considered inactive. -->
  <!-- When a user is considered inactive, they are forcibly removed -->
  <!-- from all rooms and from the application.  This is to deal with the -->
  <!-- case of a user closing the browser window without properly logging -->
  <!-- out, or possibly a Javascript error that stops the Ajax request -->
  <!-- timers.  Note that this was originally done in a SessionListener, -->
  <!-- but because of problems seem in some containers, this had to be -->
  <!-- done instead. -->
