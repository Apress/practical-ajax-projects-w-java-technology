messages.welcomeBlock1=Hello and welcome to the AjaxChat application!  This is meant to serve as an example of using AJAX with a Struts application.  But, it is also meant to be a useful application on its own.
messages.welcomeBlock2=Simply put, AjaxChat is a simple Struts-based chat application that uses AJAX.  While you can use this for real, this is in NO WAY a robust chat app!  For instance, the DAO used here uses synchronization when reading/writing messages in a room or the list of users in a room, so it is inherently not very scalable.  Still, for small-scale use, it should be fine.  You could always write a new DAO layer if you need something more robust.
